I created this project due to the defficulty involved in booking US visa interview slots. During COVID,the consulate was closed and slots were not available. This is a python program used to check if appointments are available at CGI Federal website. It takes an initial screenshot of the appointments page and then refreshes the page at intervals. After each refresh, it takes a new screenshot and compares it with the initial screenshot. If there is a difference, then the computer will start beeping.

As this program is using screenshots for comparison, it is very easy to use this program on any other website.
